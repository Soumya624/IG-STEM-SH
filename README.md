# VoiceVision: Object Recognition for the Blind

VoiceVision is an assistive technology application designed to empower individuals who are blind or have low vision by providing real-time audio descriptions of their surroundings using advanced computer vision techniques.

## Key Features

- **Image Processing**: Utilizes OpenCV for efficient image manipulation and feature extraction.
- **Object Detection**: Employs the YOLO algorithm for accurate identification of objects in images.
- **Text-to-Speech Integration**: Converts object descriptions into natural-sounding audio using the gTTS library.
